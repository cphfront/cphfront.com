We`re a community of ~1000 frontend developers in and around Copenhagen, Denmark.

##Meetup
We meet every month and have talks for 1Â½-2 hours with time to chat with fellow developers. We've also done code offs, quizzes, workshops and more. See our events and join us on [meetup.com/cphfront](http://www.meetup.com/cphfront/).


##Hosts
Hosting a meetup is a great opportunity for your company or organisation to get in touch with the finest frontend developers in Copenhagen. Read more in [info for hosts](/hosting.html).


##Speakers
Talks can be anything between 5-45 minutes on topics somewhat related to frontend development. Speaking at a meetup is a great excuse to learn more about a topic and to practice your presentation skills.
Please don't be shy:)
