Hosting a meetup is a great way for your company to profile yourself in the developer community and towards your own employees. It can also be a way to encourage your employees to stay updated as our topics tend to be fairly cutting edge â€” what's new is what's interesting.  
We are always looking for venues and are open to new ideas. Please contact us through [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/cphfront/#meta-organizers) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/cphfront).

## You can
- Do the 5min "who are we/we are hiring" pitch in the beginning
- Use the breaks to talk with any interested individuals (give them a tour etc.)

## We need
- Room for at least 50 people.
- A projector/big screen.
- A location not too far from the city centre.

## We like
- Food & drinks: We often start at 18.
- Speakers: Maybe one of your developers/designers could talk about a technology/tool you've been using.

## Resources
You can get the logo and "directional posters" from our [resources repository](https://github.com/cphfront/resources/).
