## Why?
Hosting a meetup is a great way to profile your company in the developer community and towards your own employees and encourage them to stay updated as our topics tend to be fairly cutting edge.

## Get in touch
Please contact us through [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/cphfront/#meta-organizers) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/cphfront).

## We need
- Room for at least 50 people.
- A projector/big screen.
- A location not too far from the city centre.

## We like
- Food & drinks: We often start at 18.
- Speakers: Maybe one of your developers/designers could talk about a technology/tool you've been using.

## You can
- Do the 5min "who are we/we are hiring" pitch.
- Use the breaks to talk with anyone interested (give them a tour etc.)

## Previous hosts include
Tradeshift, Plant, TwentyThree, Pentia, Founders House, Schantz A/S, Netcompany, Famly, Robocat

## Resources
You can get the logo and "directional posters" from our [resources repository](https://github.com/cphfront/resources/).
